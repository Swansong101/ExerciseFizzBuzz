# FizzBuzz Exercise

## Overview
This is a simple Java implementation of the classic **FizzBuzz** problem. The program takes a user input number and prints:
- **"FizzBuzz"** if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5.
- **"Fizz"** if the number is divisible by 3 only.
- **"Buzz"** if the number is divisible by 5 only.
- The number itself if it is not divisible by either 3 or 5.

This exercise is a great way to practice basic control structures like `if-else` or `switch` in Java.

---

## Features
- Accepts user input for a number.
- Determines the appropriate output based on divisibility rules.
- Simple and beginner-friendly logic implementation.

---

## Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
- A code editor or IDE (e.g., VS Code, IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse).

---

## How to Run
1. Clone or copy the program to your local machine.
2. Open the program in your code editor or IDE.
3. Compile the program:
   ```bash
   javac Main.java
   ```
4. Run the program:
   ```bash
   java Main
   ```
5. Enter a number when prompted, and view the output.

## Example Usage
```
Enter a number: 15
FizzBuzz
```
```
Enter a number: 9
Fizz
```
```
Enter a number: 10
Buzz
```
```
Enter a number: 7
7
```

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the use of control flow structures (`if-else` or `switch`).
- Practice working with user input in Java.
- Implement modular logic using conditions.

---

## Future Improvements
- Allow the user to input a range of numbers for bulk processing.
- Add error handling for non-numeric inputs.
- Extend functionality with GUI or web-based input/output.
